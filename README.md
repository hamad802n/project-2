## User Stories

### Guest (not signed in)

- As a guest, I want to view a hotel's details (location, price per night, amenities, rating) so that I can decide if I want to stay there.
- As a guest, I want to sign up for an account so that I can book a hotel.

### User (signed in)
- As a user, I want to sign in and sign out so that my bookings stay private to my account.
- As a user, I want to book a hotel by choosing check-in and check-out dates, number of guests and rooms so that I can reserve my stay.
- As a user, I want to see the total price before I confirm so that I know how much my stay will cost.
- As a user, I want to see a list of all my bookings so that I can keep track of my trips.
- As a user, I want to view the details of one booking so that I can check my dates and price.
- As a user, I want to edit a booking (dates, guests, rooms) so that I can change my plans.
- As a user, I want to cancel a booking so that I can remove a trip I no longer want.
- As a user, I should not be able to see, edit or cancel someone else's bookings.

### Admin (optional)
- As an admin, I want to add, edit and delete hotels so that the hotel list stays up to date.
